In-- works on multiple values(tuple )i.e works on touple         (In -nested queries)
exists- return true or false ..every row is compared with every row in another table based on where condition..if it returns any value exists return true otherwise false.  (exists-correlated subqueries)
Joins=Crossproduct+condition
1.Natural join
2.cross join
3.condtional join
4.equi join
5.self join
6.outer join-left,right,full

Cross product will be happen when we use any type of join and then it will retrive records based up on wherecondition.
when we do cross product  (TOtal number of rows) = No.of rows in one table*number of rows in another table.
cross product example :-
select d.id as departmentid ,e.id,d.department_name,e.name
from employee e,department d

1.Natural join(key word):
Example :
select d.id as departmentid ,e.id,d.department_name,e.name 
from employee e natural join department d;

select d.id as departmentid ,e.id,d.department_name,e.name 
from employee e, department d
where e.id=d.id
output :-
1	1	HR	John Doe
2	2	Finance	Jane Smith
3	3	IT	Alice Johnson
4	4	Sales	Bob Brown
//Internally natural join doing where e.id=d.id i.e checks equality on common attributes

2.Self join:
select e1.id,e1.name
from employee as e1 ,employee as e2
where e1.department_id= e2.department_id and e1.id<>e2.id ; This is called self join it is applied on same table 
with different alias names of the table
